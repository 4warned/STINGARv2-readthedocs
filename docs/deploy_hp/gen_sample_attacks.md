Deploy a Honeypot
===============

<h3>Generate Sample Honeypot Attacks</h3>

Once you've deployed a honeypot, you can generate sample attacks to verify it's working.

From the command line on your local laptop/machine, enter the following command to simulate an attack on your new honeypot.

```
ssh username@sample.domain.institution.edu
```

Then go to the STINGAR Attack Analysis page and confirm that your 'attacks' appear in the list of attack events.
