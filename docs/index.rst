STINGAR Installation Instructions
=========

STINGAR helps protect networks from malicious attacks by providing administrators with an easy way to deploy/manage honeypots & share attack data with the STINGAR community. See the STINGAR [website](https://stingar.security.duke.edu/) for more information.

You must be a member of the STINGAR community to use STINGAR. To request membership, send email to the STINGAR team: <team-stingar@duke.edu>. The team will give you an account to retrieve the STINGAR code from a Docker registry. You'll need a username/password for this registry to install STINGAR.

Each member of the STINGAR community hosts their own instance of the STINGAR application. This app helps install/manage honeypots, collects attack info and can be configured to deliver attack data to the STINGAR central repository where it's aggregated, summarized and made available to the community.

The documentation on this site describes how you can install & configure an instance of the STINGAR application and deploy a honeypot. The process involves downloading installation tools (Docker, docker-compose & python) and running a script to retrieve & configure STINGAR.
